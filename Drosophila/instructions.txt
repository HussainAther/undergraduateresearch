number of headers
number of each chromosome type
number of scaffold type

split them up into arms

chromosomes: X Y 2 3 4 
2, and 3 have two arms, so there will be a total of 7 files. There will be one for scaffolds/unknown so that will be 8.

make a dict that keeps track of each header ID and the number of times it appears in the file
